// 1. Find free bit    2. Fill Metadata   3. Allocate Block

    // 1.INODE Bitmap (AVAILIBILITY CHART) - driver reads this (consult ig.) - same is free or in use system.  -- SO THAT IT WON"T HAVE TO READ THE LARGE METADATA
    // 2. Jumps to Inode Table (THE BRAIN) and writes the metadata to fields like Type,perm,size and stuff 
    //
    // 3. Allocation of data block - scans the block bitmap and finds the corresponding free space then links the block to node data map pointers to point to it.
    //     two main things that is . and .. mapping is important and the driver will hardcode it - and map it to those nodes 
    //     and then opens the data block belonging to parent dir and appends the name to node.
    //
    // SUMMARY : Its not like memory - where it has a header-data structure - that is continous here it is scattered and fragmented - theh drive is intentionsally
    // segregated into fragments called the block groups and the inode table contains its data block and that . and .. links inside it.
    // 
    // we can't design it like a ram because to go from say one part to another part in disk i would have to make it go through the entire list 
    // taking useless time (hdd casue they are slow) and in ssd - there's a certain no i can write the ssd -- SOMETHING LIKE SILICON ENDURANCE LIMITS;
    //
    // to solve the time issue the inodes are tightly packed into a centralized inode table and the kernel can just read it and jump straight to the address.
    //  OH SO BASICALLY ALL OF THEM ARE IN ONE BLOCK SO ITS LIKE READING ONLY THAT ONE BLOCK AGAIN AND AGAIN.
    //
    //  this method was used in fat - it had CORRUPTION PROPOGATION - linked list works in ram because even if a pointer gets corrrupted no problem reload and done 
    //  but if it happens in the drive the block is permanently lost because the path to it completely lost.
    //  IN EXT4 no problem because the inode acts as a centralized master hub - if one goes bad - the master still holds path to the next block 
    //
    // 
    // WE HAVE THIS STRUCTURE IN RAM AS WELL BUT ONLY WHEN WE TALK TO THE DISK - we load it into ram CALLED In-Memory Inode Table 
    // however for normal malloc and stuff we don't use use this inodes becasue ram in volatile and physically uniform.
    // unnecessary cpu computational overhead -- accessing is easy in ram and very fast - not slow like in disks.
    //
    // HAMMERING THE SAME block in ssd will kill it - same like earlier - so it uses flash translation layer (FTL) -- remaps the flash cell dynamically.
    //
    //
    // Instead of reading inode table again from disk - take it into cachce -- called teh virtual file system (VFS)
